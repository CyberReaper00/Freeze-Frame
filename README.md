# Summary
I am creating this to help with my crippling procrastination. I have heard about Pomodoro Timers and tried using one for a while, but after some time I just began to ignore it. The problem was not that I tuned out the alarm, but that I could easily turn it off

This allowed me to create the habit of not taking a break, when the alarm went off, but to turn the alarm off and keep working. Which completely defeated the purpose of the alarm

I realized that I needed to stop myself from turning off the alarm and let it reset itself automatically, to actually make use of it

# Freeze Frame
The best way to actually do that is to make the alarm not be able to turn off or close when I am on a break
If I want to turn it off then I would have to wait for my break to end and then I can decide to keep working or not

But ofcourse, if that happens and I about to finish my work, then I can just close the window
But then I can just remove the window controls from the top, removing the possibility of closing anything
But then I can just use ALT+F4 which will work no matter what
BUT, but what if I were to create another window when the break timer starts on top of everything and you would have to close that to close the timer
Which could work, if I didn't create a failsafe that relaunched THE WALL everytime it was closed while the break timer was still running

This failsafe prevents you and ME from ignoring the timer and forcing us to take a break, instead of working continuously until we cannot work anymore

## Features
Freeze Frame will only have a handful of features, to keep it simple to use and manage
- Work Time
    Work time/start time will be the time you will start the timer and start working
- Break Time
    Break time/pause time will be the time the timer takes to pause your screen and forces you to take a break
- Profiles
    These will contain sets of work time and break time so that the program knows how long to continue each section before starting the next one
    A profile makes the program automatic and allows you to keep working the entire day
    Multiple profiles can be created for different tasks

The completed program, because of it's simpicity, will not be getting any PR's
The written features will be the only things implemented into the program

If you wish to add more features and want to improve it in some way, feel free to fork the repo
This is all the work I need to do and what I will do the project, anything extra is unnecessary

The finished program will have a download link <here>
